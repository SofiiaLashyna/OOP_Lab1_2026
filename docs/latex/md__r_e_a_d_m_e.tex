﻿\# Project1 \doxylink{class_galaxy}{Galaxy} Simulation is a C++ programming educational project that models the structure of a galaxy using graphs. Each astronomical object (star, star system, planet, etc.) is represented as a vertex of a graph, and the connections between them are represented as edges with weights (e.\+g., distance between systems).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{The project demonstrates\+:}{The project demonstrates\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}
